# Introduction

## Using generative AI to generate information for an application

Welcome to our lab! In this lab we'll be using [watsonx](https://www.ibm.com/watsonx) to build an application which leverages [generative AI](https://developer.ibm.com/generative-ai-for-developers/?utm_medium=OSocial&utm_source=Event&utm_content=DEVWW&utm_term=watsonx&utm_id=watsonxevent) to generate information for the app. The goals of this lab are to:

* Learn how to use generative AI by prompt engineering [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model) using [watsonx.ai](https://www.ibm.com/products/watsonx-ai) prompt lab
* Develop an application which uses the LLM (from prompt engineering) to generate relevant information
* Understand the value of AI in your applications
